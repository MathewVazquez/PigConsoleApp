# PigConsoleApp
This is a C# console app remake of the game of pig. I coded this a few years ago as a project for a python course I took in high school, and decided to remake it a few years later in C# since I'm just starting to learn the language and am getting back into coding. This is my first ever project posted on GitHub.
